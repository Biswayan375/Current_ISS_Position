# Current_ISS_Position
Simply fetches the data of the ISS position and map from APIs and visualizes in an interesting way

I was very upset when I found out that my site is deployed via github pages but because it has an HTTP API call, it didn't work.
I also tried in netlify but there also they force HTTPS. In future if I am able to deploy it successfully, I'll surely add the 
link here :)
