        <p>I was learning about APIs in the past few days from YouTube obviously. The channel is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman'>The Coding Train</a> of Daniel Shiffman. That man is a Great Teacher. He used this API called <a href="open-notify.org">open-notify.org</a> in one of his videos and I got the idea from that video to represent the data like this. I found this maps library on that API's website. They have built something similar to this as an example on their site and as here in my implementation, there is a link below to that library, same was in their website. Enough shit talk, <font color=blue>Happy Coding!</font></p>
